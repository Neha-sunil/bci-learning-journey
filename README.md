# 🧠 What is a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)?

A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that enables direct communication between the **human brain and an external device** – like a computer, robot, or prosthetic limb.

Instead of using traditional input methods like keyboards or voice, BCIs decode brain activity and allow users to **control systems using just their thoughts**.

## 🧬 How Does a BCI Work?

BCIs work in 3 main steps:

1. **Recording brain signals** – often using **EEG (Electroencephalography)** devices.
2. **Signal Processing** – filtering noise and extracting key features from the brainwaves.
3. **Classification** – using Machine Learning to interpret and translate thoughts into actions.

## 🌍 Applications of BCI

- 🧑‍🦽 **Assistive Tech** – Controlling wheelchairs, prosthetics for paralyzed individuals  
- 🧠 **Neurotherapy** – Helping patients with epilepsy, ADHD, PTSD  
- 🎮 **Gaming & AR/VR** – Mind-controlled immersive experiences  
- 🚀 **Future Interfaces** – Companies like **Neuralink** are building next-gen BCI implants
